Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko was born 9.03.1814,
also known as Kobzar Taras, or simply Kobzar,
was a Ukrainian poet, writer, artist, public
and political figure, as well as folklorist and
ethnographer. His literary heritage is regarded
to be the foundation of modern Ukrainian literature
and, to a large extent, the modern Ukrainian language,
though the language of his poems was different from
the modern Ukrainian language. Shevchenko is also known
 for many masterpieces as a painter and an illustrator.
